To set up and use the WAX Blockchain, it's recommended that you use our  <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/waxteam" target="_blank">waxteam - Docker Images</a>.  Our docker images provide a fast, fully supported way to run a node in seconds. Refer to [Docker Quickstart](/es/dapp-development/docker-setup/) for more information.

Our production and development Docker images include everything that's available from the <a href="https://github.com/worldwide-asset-exchange/wax-blockchain" target="_blank">WAX Blockchain Source Code Repository</a>, allowing you to run WAX nodes and build and deploy smart contracts.

If you'd like to access our sample contracts and scripts from your local drive or have a need to install the WAX Blockchain instead of using Docker, you can use this guide to download and optionally build the WAX Blockchain source code.

<strong>Important:</strong> At this time, pre-compiled packages are not available. Support is <strong>not</strong> available when you build the WAX blockchain from source.{: .label .label-yellow }

## What's Included

The WAX Blockchain is a fork of <a href="https://developers.eos.io/" target="_blank">EOSIO</a>. This <a href="https://github.com/worldwide-asset-exchange/wax-blockchain" target="_blank">WAX Blockchain Source Code Repository</a> includes and installs:

- WAX Blockchain source code
- Dependencies
- [Blockchain Tools](/es/tools/blockchain_tools), including keosd, nodeos, and cleos
- Sample contracts

You can use these components to manage local wallets, create local accounts, interact with the WAX Blockchain, and more. 

<strong>EOS Developers:</strong> Building the WAX Source Code Repository will overwrite a previous EOS installation.
