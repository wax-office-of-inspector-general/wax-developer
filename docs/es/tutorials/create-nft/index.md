You can easily create non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the WAX Blockchain using the <a href="https://github.com/CryptoLions/SimpleAssets" target="_blank">Simple Assets</a> smart contract.

<a href="https://www.simpleassets.io/" target="_blank">Simple Assets</a> is a standard developed by <a href="https://cryptolions.io/" target="_blank">CryptoLions</a>, an EOSIO and WAX block producer. Using the Simple Assets smart contract, you can quickly create in-game items, cards, stickers, and other unique collectibles. 

In this guide, you'll learn how the Simple Assets smart contract works and use our step-by-step guide to create an NFT on the WAX Blockchain. If you'd like to jump right to the code, refer to [Use Simple Assets](/es/tutorials/create-nft/nft_basics).

## How it Works

The Simple Assets smart contract offers several actions to help you create and manage digital assets on the WAX Blockchain, including the ability to:

* Create and transfer assets
* Search for and display asset info
* Update certain asset attributes

The following video from Simple Assets demonstrates the core functionality of the Simple Assets smart contract.

## Before You Begin

* You'll need to complete our [Docker Quickstart](/es/dapp-development/docker-setup/) (recommended).
* To compile your smart contract, you'll need to use [WAX-CDT](/es/dapp-development/wax-cdt/cdt_use).
* To deploy your smart contract to the WAX mainnet, you'll need to create a self-managed WAX Blockchain Account.
