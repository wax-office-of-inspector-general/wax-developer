# Supported Operating Systems

WAX currently supports the following operating systems:

* Amazon 2017.09 and higher
* Centos 7
* Ubuntu 16.04
* Ubuntu 18.04
* MacOS 10.14.x and higher 

## Deprecated Operating Systems

Support is no longer available for the following operating systems:

* Mint 18
* Fedora 27
* Amazon Linux 1
* macOS versions earlier than 10.14 (such as High Sierra)

## Virtual Machines

If you're using a virtual machine, it should be configured with at least 2 CPUs (does not have to be two physical ones) and 8G of memory.

## Windows Users

The quickest, easiest way to run the WAX Blockchain on Windows is to use our Docker images. Refer to [Docker Quickstart](/es/dapp-development/docker-setup/) to get started. 

If you're an advanced Window's developer with an understanding of Linux, you do have other options:

* Use <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">VirtualBox</a> (or a similar app) to create a Linux virtual machine
* Use Microsoft's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/" target="_blank">Introduction to Hyper-V on Windows 10</a> to create a Linux virtual machine
* Use Microsoft's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10" target="_blank">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>
