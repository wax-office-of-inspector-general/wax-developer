The WAX Blockchain RPC API includes public endpoints used to get block information, block history, node information, and node producer information. Exposed through **nodeos** plugins, this API is available on the WAX mainnet and your local development environment. 

<strong>Note:</strong> If you're making local requests, <strong>nodeos</strong> must be running.

| Environment | URL |
| --- | ----------- |
| WAX mainnet | https://chain.wax.io |
| Local Testnet | http://127.0.0.1:8888 |

You can make API requests directly to blockchain endpoints:

```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:8888/v1/chain/get_info \
  --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8'
```

You can also call these endpoints using **cleos** commands:

```
cleos -u https://chain.wax.io get info
```
