# Cloud Wallet  Quickstart

When users sign up or sign in to Cloud Wallet , a WAX Blockchain Account is automatically created. Users can easily manage their resources, blockchain transactions, NFTs, and whitelisted dApps from the Cloud Wallet  dashboard. 

In this guide, you'll learn how to use **WaxJS** to connect to the Cloud Wallet , allowing you to:

* Sign in users with Google, Facebook, Twitter, KakaoTalk, Reddit, and other social platforms
* Get blockchain account names, public keys, and permissions
* Easily execute smart contract transactions from your client
