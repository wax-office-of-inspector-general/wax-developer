# Consensus

Behind the scenes of the WAX blockchain lies a sophisticated consensus mechanism that ensures fast, secure, and energy-efficient transactions. 

## Understanding Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS):

WAX Blockchain uses a delegated Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism rather than an energy-inefficient Proof-of-Work system.
Under this model, youâ€™ll stake WAXP for a share of CPU and NET resources. These resources are finite, and they dictate how many transactions can be validated and committed to the WAX Blockchain per block.

## Consensus Achieved Through Delegation:

In the WAX ecosystem, token holders can participate in the consensus process by voting for block producers (BPs). These BPs, elected by the community, are responsible for verifying transactions and adding them to the blockchain. Through this delegated voting system, consensus is achieved in a more efficient and decentralized manner.


## Benefits of DPoS for WAX:

Scalability: The DPoS mechanism employed by WAX allows for high transaction throughput, enabling the network to handle a large volume of transactions. This scalability ensures a smooth user experience, even during periods of high network activity.

Security: DPoS enhances the security of the WAX blockchain by enabling fast block confirmation times. 

Energy Efficiency: Compared to traditional proof-of-work (PoW) mechanisms, DPoS consumes significantly less energy. By eliminating the need for resource-intensive mining, WAX significantly reduces its environmental footprint, making it a more sustainable blockchain solution.
