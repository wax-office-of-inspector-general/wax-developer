# What is the WAX blockchain?

WAX Blockchain, recognized as the King of NFTs, is a leading layer 1 blockchain platform that revolutionizes the creation, trading, and ownership of digital assets. It boasts the largest user base and transaction volume in the industry, as verified by [Dappradar.com](https://dappradar.com/). WAX's mission is to make NFTs accessible to the mass market through a secure, eco-friendly, and user-friendly marketplace.

Founded in 2017 by William E. Quigley and Jonathan Yantis, WAX has facilitated the exchange of over 360 million digital collectibles, collaborating with renowned brands like NASCAR, AMC, Mattel, and Hasbro. WAX pioneered the connection of NFTs to physical consumer products, offering exciting possibilities for consumer product companies, known as vIRLsÂ®. 
WAX extends its influence beyond collectibles, serving as a leading network for entertainment NFTs and web3 games in the metaverse. Notable blockchain games like Alien Worlds and Splinterlands find their home on the WAX platform. Its success lies in its user-friendly infrastructure, enabling seamless experiences for crypto enthusiasts and newcomers alike, with no transaction fees and impressive scalability.

Operating on a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism, WAX ensures fast transactions and high throughput, catering to the demands of digital asset trading. Moreover, its interoperability capabilities allow for integration with other blockchains and external systems, enhancing the reach and utility of WAX-created digital assets.
WAX Blockchain has a deep and incredible community full of artists, creators, developers, and entrepreneurs that band together to enhance the tools and capabilities of the chain. Some developers have provided easy tools to create and launch digital commerce sales and some have even delved into the digital to physical space. Teams like [BountyBlok](https://www.bountyblok.io/), [NFT Hive](https://nfthive.io/) and [Atomic Hub](https://wax.atomichub.io/) are just a few examples of how this community has made it easy for people to create, buy, sell, trade on WAX Blockchain.
