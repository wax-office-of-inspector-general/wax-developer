# WAX Random Number Generator

The WAX Random Number Generator (WAX RNG) is a native blockchain service that provides provably fair random numbers for single-users. Based on the <a href="https://github.com/gluk256/misc/blob/master/rng4ethereum/signidice.md" target="_blank">Signidice algorithm</a>, WAX RNG offers excellent randomization, a cleaner workflow, and lightning-fast RSA verification.
