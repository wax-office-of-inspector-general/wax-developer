A WAX smart contract is a WASM compiled C++ file that executes actions on the WAX Blockchain and stores persistent data on every WAX full node's RAM.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create, compile, and deploy a WAX smart contract to your local development environment.

## Before You Begin

- You'll need to complete our [Docker Quickstart](/build/dapp-development/docker-setup/) (recommended) or use the [WAX Blockchain Setup](/build/dapp-development/wax-blockchain-setup/) to build from source.
- Have your local development environment ready. Refer to [Set Up a Local dApp Environment](/build/dapp-development/) for more information.
- To compile and deploy your smart contract locally, you'll need to use the [WAX Contract Development Toolkit (WAX-CDT)](/build/dapp-development/wax-cdt/) and be familiar with basic concepts like WASM and ABI file generation.
