Running WAX software can be very demanding on compute resources especially on the extremely busy WAX Mainnet. Other than the requirement for a snappy CPU, WAX Software runs the entire network in resident memory and maps this memory to a thin provisioned memory mapped file called the state database which means that some lofty RAM and Disk IO requirements also need to be met.

This guide will work through an example of managing RAM and Disk requirements in an effectively and economical way.

_This article has been updated to incorporate the_ [_Antelope_](https://antelope.io/) _Leap software build process._

# Optimising RAM and Disk Utilisation

There are two challenges this article will address, managing usage of RAM and managing the amount of Disk IO. RAM is costly and often limited on a specific hardware platform and Solid State Disks have a limited lifetime based on the amount of writes that occur (SSD Endurance).

At time of writing (27th December 2022) the WAX Mainnet’s node memory utilisation is **85.6GB** and fluctuating by the minute.

Currently there are two effective mechanisms to manage RAM and Disk IO. The first is using WAX Software’s  `heap`  mode, which preloads the state database into RAM on node start. The second and what this article’s example will walk through is utilising the Linux Kernel’s  **tmpfs**  mechanism and a large amount of disk  **swap**.

_tmpfs is a Linux file system that keeps all of it’s files in virtual memory, the contents of this folder are temporary meaning if this folder is unmounted or the server rebooted all contents will be lost._

It has been discovered through testing by the community (Aaron Cox and Stan cc32d9) that much of the resident memory data isn’t accessed very frequently and can be swapped to disk. This understanding means we can be far more efficient on our RAM utilisation and Disk IO demands.

## Summary of the tmpfs memory strategy

This strategy is currently working for EOSphere in our production environment, even on nodes that have enough RAM. Offsetting the constant writes to disk appear to be saving our SSD’s. At time of writing a production node is able to run effectively configured like this with only 64GB of RAM.

In summary this example will do the following:

1.  Mount a tmpfs folder
2.  Create a large swap file
3.  Configure nodeos to use the tmpfs folder for state
4.  Start nodeos from a snapshot

## tmpfs

This example will have a 128GB State Database which will be placed in the tmpfs folder which will be 129GB to ensure it‘s big enough’.

Configure  `fstab`  as below:

```
> sudo nano /etc/fstabtmpfs   /home/eosphere/waxdata/state  tmpfs rw,nodev,nosuid,size=129G,x-systemd.after=zfs-mount.service 0

> sudo mount -a

**check that is was mounted**
> df -h
```

## swap

Linux swap can be configured in it’s own partition or as a file, from our experience using SSD’s (non spindle disks) there hasn’t been any issue using a file and gives us the ability to easily adjust the swap size.

Swap will be configured as 128GB as below:

```
***Turn off existing swap, which would probably be a partition***
> sudo swapoff -a

> sudo fallocate -l 128G /swap.img

> sudo chmod 600 /swap.img

> sudo mkswap /swap.img

> sudo swapon /swap.img

***Configure fstab and comment out the old swap statement***
> sudo nano /etc/fstab
/swap.img   none    swap    sw    0   0
```

## nodeos and snapshot start

Ensure that the state database is at least 128GB for now, this will need to monitored as network available memory is constantly expanding.

Configure as below:

```
***Configure State Database Size***  
> cd ~/waxdata  

> nano config.ini
chain-state-db-size-mb = 131072
```

Start  `nodeos`  from a  [snapshot](https://medium.com/eosphere/wax-technical-how-to-2-db45a339e735)  available  [here](https://snapshots.eosphere.io/), as the mounted tmpfs is where  `nodeos`  expects the state folder will be located state will be built in virtual memory.

Start as below:

```
> cd ~/wax-leap/build/programs/nodeos

> ./nodeos --data-dir ~/waxdata --config-dir ~/waxdata --snapshot ~/waxdata/snapshots/snapshot.bin
```

Start up will take longer than usual as a new state file is created from the snapshot as well as even longer if the nodes physical RAM is exhausted and swap is used. In the case of 64GB of RAM this took about 45mins.

Subsequent restarts of nodeos won’t require a snapshot to start unless your node is rebooted or the tmpfs unmounted.

Of course as already mentioned the WAX Mainnet memory requirements are constantly expanding, regular monitoring of usage and performance will need to guide your hardware requirements and configuration.
