<a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a> is a *container* platform that's similar to a virtual machine. Docker allows you to run software, applications, and even operating systems like Ubuntu from an isolated environment. Refer to Docker's <a href="https://www.docker.com/why-docker" target="_blank">Overview</a> guide to learn more.

Our development and production Docker images provide a fast, easy way to run the WAX Blockchain in minutes. You can also use our Docker images to build and deploy smart contracts.

Using our Docker environment offers the following benefits:

* Adds convenience and speed to your development efforts
* Eliminates the need to manage source code 
* Eliminates the need to meet our [Supported Operating Systems](/en/tools/os) requirements
* Doesn't overwrite an existing installation of EOSIO
* Makes it easy to upgrade and try out new features
* Makes it easy to switch between production and development environments
