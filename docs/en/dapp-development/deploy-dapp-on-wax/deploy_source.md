In this guide, you'll use the `cleos set contract` command to deploy your smart contract to the WAX mainnet.

Before you begin, you'll need to compile your smart contract and have your WASM and ABI files ready. Refer to [Smart Contract Quickstart](/en/dapp-development/smart-contract-quickstart) or [WAX-CDT Build Tools](/en/dapp-development/wax-cdt/cdt_cpp) for more information.

You'll also need to:

* Create a self-managed WAX Blockchain Account. 
* Make sure you have enough WAX staked in your account to allocate resources. 

To deploy your smart contract to the WAX mainnet:

1. Open and unlock your wallet. 

    ```shell
    cleos wallet open -n mywallet && cleos wallet unlock -n mywallet --password {wallet.pwd}
    ```

2. Generate a public/private key pair that's used to create your smart contract's blockchain account. From the command line, use the `cleos create key` command:

    ```shell
    cleos wallet create_key -n mywallet
    ```

    <strong>Note:</strong> You can also use an EOSIO compatible wallet (e.g., Scatter).

3. From the command line, use `cleos system newaccount` to create your smart contract's account. To run this command, you'll need to have the proper authority. This means that the wallet containing your primary account must be opened and unlocked.

    ```shell
    cleos -u https://chain.wax.io system newaccount waxdappacct1 HelloWorld10 EOS7jEb46pDiWvA39faCoFn3jUdn6LfL51irdXbvfpuSko86iNU5x --stake-net '0.50000000 WAX' --stake-cpu '0.50000000 WAX' --buy-ram-kbytes 32
    ```

    <strong>Note:</strong> You'll need to repeat Steps 1 and 2 for each of your contracts.

4. **Deploy.** From the command line, set your contract with the `cleos set contract` command: 

    | Parameter | Example | Description
    | --- | ----------- | -------------------------- |
    | -u | -u https://chain.wax.io | This is the WAX Blockchain URL. |
    | contractAccount| HelloWorld10 | Your smart contract's account (created in Step 2). |
    | fullPath | d/wax-blockchain/wax-cdt/mycontracts/wax/build | The full path to your WASM and ABI files. |
    | wasmName | wax | Name of your WASM file. |
    | abiName | wax | Name of your ABI file. |

    ```shell
    cleos -u https://chain.wax.io set contract HelloWorld10 d/wax-blockchain/wax-cdt/mycontracts/wax/build wax.wasm wax.abi
    ```

Your dApp is now live on WAX! 

<strong>Note:</strong> Depending on how your dApp's onboarding process is built, your customers may need to create a WAX Account to use your dApp on WAX.
