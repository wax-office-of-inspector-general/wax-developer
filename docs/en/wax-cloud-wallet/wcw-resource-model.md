WAX Cloud Wallet Simplifies Resource Model, Opens Selective Whitelisting Process to Make the Blockchain More Efficient
Here at WAX, it’s always been our mission to make the blockchain affordable, easy to navigate and fun.

Beginning in the summer of 2022, we will be rolling out a series of changes to our WAX Cloud Wallet resource model. These changes will improve the user experience for all of our transactions, simultaneously hindering automated play and malicious behavior that is increasingly prevalent and impact resource availability for the entire blockchain.

Read more below about our ongoing efforts to make the WAX Blockchain stronger and more efficient than ever.

Resource Availability Is a Risk to the WAX Ecosystem
Coordinated automated play across multiple accounts has become one of the most significant challenges facing blockchain games today. We have continued to see increased transaction volume and resource utilization by blockchain-based botnets on WAX. The activity of these bad actors dwarfs that of human users, resulting in reduced availability of resources and poor user experience across the entire blockchain.

In short, botnets are not only harmful to our users, they are harmful to the chain itself.

In an effort to increase resource availability and improve the transaction user experience for all users on the WAX Blockchain, we will be making the WAX Cloud Wallet resource boost system available only to users using whitelisted dApps. Additionally, we will be adding a transaction fee for each transaction performed on dApps that are not whitelisted.

Simplifying Our Resource Model
The WAX resource model is unique in its approach to transaction costs, and this allows us to offer users a daily resource pool that enables fast, free interactions with the chain.

Currently, the systems for resource purchasing and staking (see the (WAX Cloud Wallet Resource Model)[https://medium.com/wax-io/psa-wax-cloud-wallet-resource-model-2-0-ebc96d878645]) in the WAX Blockchain ecosystem create some problematic edge cases and can be difficult to understand for those who are familiar with the behavior of other gas fee based blockchains.

That’s why we are moving forward with a new WAX Cloud Wallet Resource Boost Model. This model is simple to understand and easy to use for any user with a wallet, and most importantly it alleviates the need to purchase and stake resources before using any dApps.

For all users who use dApps that are not whitelisted by the WAX Cloud Wallet team, we will be implementing a 0.1 WAXP pay per transaction (PPT) fee to guarantee that all WCW transactions can be efficiently processed and that users have a clear and transparent view of how transaction costs work on WAX.

The existing WAX Cloud Wallet boost model that provides a limited amount of free resources to users per day will still work exactly the same, however, dApps will be required to meet certain whitelisting criteria to be eligible.

We will be publishing a detailed whitelisting process shortly.

Additional Notes

For WCW users interacting with WAX whitelisted dApps, the per-transaction fee will only apply after users have exhausted their existing resources:

WCW Boost Resources
User Staked Resources
For WCW users interacting with all other dApps, the per-transaction fee will always apply regardless of user-staked resources status.

Note: This is not a change to the current staking model for the WAX Blockchain. The PPT resource model will be implemented for WCW users only.

If you’ve got a dApp or video game that connects to WAX, we strongly encourage you to apply to be whitelisted ASAP to reduce any negative impact on your users.
