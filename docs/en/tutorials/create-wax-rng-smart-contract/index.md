In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create and deploy a WAX RNG smart contract.

<strong>Note:</strong> At this time, the WAX RNG service is not available from a local development environment. You'll need to publish your smart contract to the WAX mainnet or WAX testnet to test it.

## Before You Begin

* You'll need to complete our [Docker Quickstart](/en/dapp-development/docker-setup/) (recommended) or use the [WAX Blockchain Setup](/en/dapp-development/wax-blockchain-setup/) to build from source.
* To compile and deploy your smart contract, you'll need to use the [WAX Contract Development Toolkit (WAX-CDT)](/en/dapp-development/wax-cdt/).
<!-- This is not needed -->
<!-- * Install the [WAX Random Number Generator (WAX RNG)](/en/tutorials/wax-rng/). -->
* To deploy your smart contract to the WAX mainnet or WAX testnet, you'll need to create a self-managed WAX Blockchain Account.

<strong>New Developers:</strong> If you're new to dApp development, it's recommended that you review our [Create a Smart Contract](/en/dapp-development/wax-cdt) Quickstart.
