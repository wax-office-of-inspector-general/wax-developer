## Build Error in Function `fork_once_func'

**Error Description:** WAX Source Code Repository Build Issue

After running `sudo ./wax_install.sh` to build the WAX Source Code Repository on **Ubuntu 18.04**, the command line reports an error "In function 'fork_once_func'" (around [90%]):

```

```

Shortly after receiving this error, the build stops with the following message: 

```
MAKE building EOSIO has exited with the above error. 
```

### Fix

You can use the steps below to fix the issue and resume the WAX Source Code Repository build process.

1. From the command line, change your directory to:

```
cd patches/fc
```

2. From the <span class="sampleCode">patches/fc</span> directory, run:

```
./apply_patch.sh
```

3. When the patch completes, change your directory to:

```
cd ../../build
```

4. From the **build** directory, run:

```
make -j $(nproc)
```

You should now be able to continue the build process.
